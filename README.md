WE WANT TO HAVE A BROWSER EXTENSION WHICH WILL:

- On page load, will check all the valid email address on the page

- Will highlight all the valid email

- Will attach a click handler on the highlighted email Ids

- On click of email Ids will open a small pop-up to ask (Send email?)

- On click on small pop-up will open another popup to show the actual mailer box
